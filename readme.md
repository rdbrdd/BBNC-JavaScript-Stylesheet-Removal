# Strips BBNC and all other <link> tag stylesheets

BBNC is a frustrating application to work with.  I created this to remove stylesheets from a page allowing for a page to truly blank inregards to CSS.


## Directions

Create an "Unformatted Text" part and select advanced options and check display just before the closing body tag. That should be it.
