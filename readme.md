BBNC is a frustrating application to work with to say the least.  This simple snippet removes all stylesheets associated with a `<link>` tag. The purpose is to allow you to have clean slate to build on when creating various custom content.


## Directions

Create an "Unformatted Text" part and select advanced options and check display just before the closing body tag. That should be it.
